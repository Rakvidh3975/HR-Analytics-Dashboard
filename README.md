## 🔍 Insights  
Attrition is highest in the mid-level age group (30–40 years) and in sales-related roles, indicating potential job stress or lack of career growth.
Male employees show slightly higher attrition compared to females.
IT and Sales departments face higher turnover, requiring better retention strategies.
Average salary gaps exist between departments, which may contribute to dissatisfaction.
Most employees belong to the 25–35 age bracket, showing a young workforce but also higher volatility.
Hiring trends show an increase in recruitment in the last quarter, possibly to backfill attrition losses.

 ✅Final Conclusion
The HR Analytics Dashboard highlights key problem areas like departmental attrition, salary disparities, and demographic trends. It empowers HR leaders to:
Focus on retention programs in high-turnover departments.
Review salary structures to improve employee satisfaction.
Design career development opportunities for mid-career professionals.
